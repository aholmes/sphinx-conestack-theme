The conestack sphinx template works on the following breakpoints:

    - tablet: ``min-width: 769px`` and ``max-width: 991px``
    - desktop: ``min-width: 992px``


Mobile View
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is lesser or equal than 768px, no sidebars will be visible.

The global table of contents (``globaltoc``) and searchbar are accessible from a dropdown menu in the header.

Tablet View
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is greater than 769px and smaller than 991px, 
the global table of contents (``globaltoc``) is visible and the local table of contents 
(``localtoc``) is hidden.

The search box appears in the header element.

Desktop View
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the window width is greater than 992px, both (``globaltoc``) and (``localtoc``) are visible
as left and right sidebar, respectively.

The search box appears in the header element.
